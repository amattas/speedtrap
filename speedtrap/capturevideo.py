        Captures video frames from a connected web cam.

        Captures video frames from a connected web cam using the cv2 module. This method is intended
        to called as its own multiprocessing.Process() and uses a multiprocessing.Queue() to store captured video
        frames. This method also utilizes multiprocessing.Pipe() to control its behavior.

        Parameters
        ----------
        capture_child : Pipe
            This is one half of a bidirectional multiprocessing.Pipe(). It's used to control the behavior of the
            method. Possible values include: -1 which will cause the process to clean-up and exit gracefully, 0
            (the default) which will cause the capture process to store video in a ring buffer until its maximum size is
            reached, and 1 which will cause the capture process to store video in a ring buffer without enforcing a
            maximum size (to prevent a race condition during recording)
        capture_speed_child : Pipe
            This is one half of a bidirectional  multiprocessing.Pipe(). It is used to log the current speed to be
            imprinted on the video frames.
        video_queue : Queue()
            This FIFO multiprocessing.Queue() is used as a ring buffer for capturing video to. Due to the delay in
            switching a web cam into record mode using a ring buffer is necessary to ensure that the full video stream
            is captured.
